                                            computer or mobile device. The content of a cookie can be retrieved or read only by the server that
                                            creates the cookie. The text in a cookie often consists of identifiers, site names, and some numbers
                                            and characters. Cookies are unique to the browsers or mobile applications you use, and enable

                                            across multiple visits. Cookies allow websites to remember your settings such as language, font size
                                            on your computer or mobile device, or other browser preferences. This means that a user does not

                                            you as a new visitor every time you load a web page. For example, if you are redirected to another

                                                cookies stored on your computer, and most web browsers provide the option of blocking cookies.
                                                However, by doing so, you have to change the user settings every time you visit our website. You
